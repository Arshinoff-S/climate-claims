Hedke’s argument is straightforward and intuitive: sea levels are not rising despite an increase in CO2 emissions, and therefore “CO2 is not, and has never been, an air pollutant” (2017, p.11). He does this comparing sea level data from ten coastal cities, often beginning over 100 years ago, with CO2 emission levels, showing that while sea level rise is occurring in these cities, it has been happening at a fairly constant rate over the past 100 years, while CO2 emission levels have increased significantly. These 100-year increases of between three and 16 inches are significantly smaller than the massive rise in sea levels seen 20,000 years ago, during the retreat of ice sheets. Because the data suggests that there is no massive sea level rise occurring due to anthropogenic climate change, anthropogenic climate change must be a myth and CO2 must not be an air pollutant (Hedke, 2017).

The most glaring flaw in Hedke’s reasoning is that, even if global sea level rise due to anthropogenic climate change is a myth, this does not mean that anthropogenic climate change altogether is a myth, or that CO2 is not an air pollutant. He draws this conclusion without addressing a single other effect of climate change, such as global temperature increases, rising natural disaster frequency and intensity, or ocean acidification. What is clearly being implied, though, is that the mass panic about rising sea levels not aligning with evidence proves that the entire field of climate science is inherently flawed, or is completely dishonest. In other words, because they were wrong about this one specific component of climate change, they must be wrong about it all. Hedke does not consider that climate scientists could make mistakes, or that their conclusions may have been scientifically rigorous at the time but are now outdated. 

On top of this, his actual data analysis is far from perfect. While the ten cities that he chooses to analyse are spread-out and encompass a diverse range of climates, he does not explain why he chose those particular ten cities. This looks suspiciously as if Hedke may be lying by omission, purposefully choosing ten cities that prove his point while ignoring more extreme examples that may suggest that the so-called “alarmists” aren’t exaggerating, such as Jakarta (Esteban et al., 2020). As well, his graphs (Figure 1) are cleverly manipulated to make his science seem more solid. He has made the decision to graph sea level and carbon emissions on the same graphs, and likely chose his scales to make it seem as if sea level rise was insignificant compared to carbon emission rise. In fact, the scales are arbitrary as they measures two different values, and could have just as easily been manipulated to show a drastic rise in sea level. As well, he chooses to assume that sea level rise will continue linearly without explaining why; presumably, it was because it helped him make his point.

Perhaps most notably, this document doesn’t provide any background information. One of the most crucial steps of scientific writing is to review the already-existing literature on your chosen topic (Turbek et al., 2016). If he did this, he might realize that a lot of this “alarmism” around sea levels is about relative sea level, rather than absolute (Rovere, Stocchi and Vacchi, 2016), the latter of which he measured. Of course, because this was as an independent report, rather than in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, he will never have to address these problems (Hedke, 2017).
